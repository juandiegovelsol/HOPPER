The script fails to add the required fields like "id_producto" and "nombre" to match the
expected JSON format, and it uses an incorrect logic for the "Reabastecer" condition by
only considering "stock_sucursal_principal" and applying the wrong comparison.


The code has runtime issues when trying to process data as the code does not handle blank spaces included in the CSV example.



The response is sufficiently clear, the structure is simple and easy to understand. The code is well-documented and structured.





Both @Response 1 and @Response 2 are very useless for the prompt's needs. They both fail to run with the example CSV, as they do not correctly parse its cells when the comma separator has a space after. This produces the JSON output to fail, as it does not convert the timestamp values to a JSON-compatible format. 

They also do not follow the desired JSON output format, removing the field 'id_producto' and not renaming the CSV column 'Producto' to key 'nombre' in the JSON. Neither of them converts the timestamp value they obtain for "fecha_ultimo_abastecimiento" to a date format. 

Additionally, both @Response 1 and @Response 2 use an incorrect logic for the "Reabastecer" condition by considering "stock_sucursal_principal" for deciding if a store needs restocking and using an incorrect formula.

I think @Response 2 is slightly better than @Response 1, as @Response 1 JSON output provides the result for the "Reabastecer" field in integer format, while @Response 2 uses a boolean, as required by the prompt.
